      Taxonomy XML
    </h1>
    <p>
      This module makes it possible to import and export
      vocabularies and taxonomy terms from various formats. See
      <a href="!formats">formats.html</a> in the module folder for more detail about the
      supported syntax.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once installed and enabled, it provides a list of
      downloadable documents for each vocabulary at <a href="!downloads">"Taxonomy Export"</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      To import a vocabulary, use <a href="!upload">"Administer > Taxonomy > Import"</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      As well as importing from other Drupal sites, vocabularies can be imported
      from a number of different sources and syntaxes, including online 
      taxonomy servers. For more detail, see the module docs about 
      <a href="!formats">formats</a> and <a href="!services">services</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      If you want to add the terms to an existing vocabulary, use
      the "Target vocabulary" selector.<br />
      If you select "determined by source file", the target
      vocabulary will be specified by the XML document itself, if
      possible. Not all formats or inputs support this, 
      in which case you will get a default container named "Imported Vocabulary".
    </p>
    <p>
      Drupal-specific configurations (such as the related node
      types, or the free-tagging property) will probably not be
      imported from anything but the custom format, so you'll want
      to review the new vocabulary edit page when it's done.<br />
      To avoid duplications, already-existing terms will not be
      added unless chosen in the settings. The normal behavior is
      to attempt to merge with existing vocabs.<br />
    </p>
    <h3>Unique IDs for terms</h3>
    <p>
      It's highly unlikely that term IDs can be meaningfully shared
      between systems, so the tid field and vid is NOT retained. Instead,
      terms are looked up by name (string match) and vocabulary
      when looking for existing terms. Just because you've
      duplicated a vocabulary, does not mean it's identically
      numbered as the original. They will usually get new, unique
      IDs.
    </p>
    <p>
      String matching has some weaknesses 
      (compare "Paris", Texas with "Paris", France)
      <em>which cannot be resolved unless you more to a stricter import method</em>
      such as GUID/URI described below.
      Failing that, your terms must include a full unique string 
      ("Paris, Texas") as the full name.
    </p>
    <h3>Shared URIS for terms</h3>
    <p>
      For really powerful sharing of taxonomies, you should be able to match
      you local terms with public URIs from <a href="!services">known data providers</a>.
      This is semantically useful internally <em>and <b>required</b> for importing
      large, spidered vocabularies</em>.
      If you want to usefully import large numbers of structured terms, 
      you should follow the extra install instructions for <a href="!rdf">enabling URI 
      and RDF support</a> for terms.
      <br/>If this is not enabled, remote imports of multi-file lookups
      will still mostly work, but without any parent-child structure.
